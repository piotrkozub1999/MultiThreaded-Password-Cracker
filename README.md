## MultiThreaded Password Cracker

The program is used to test the increase performance of application depending on the number of CPU threads used. 
The algorithm searches the English dictionary to crack the hashed word.
Three hashing methods are used:
- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA256

#### To execute project on linux use command:

##### mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && ./hash_cracker


Here you can see the results for MD5 alghoritm during 1000 hashes breaking:
